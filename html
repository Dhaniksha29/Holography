        <h2>What is Holography?</h2>
        <p>Holography creates three-dimensional images of objects. Developed by <strong>Dennis Gabor (1947-48)</strong>. The recorded image is called a <strong>hologram</strong>. The process involves recording light scattered from an object and reconstructing it using coherent light.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional photography, which captures only the intensity of light, holography records both the intensity and phase of light waves, allowing for the creation of realistic three-dimensional images. This enables holograms to display depth and perspective, making them appear lifelike from different viewing angles.</p>
        <p>Holography is widely used in various fields, including security (holograms on credit cards and passports), data storage, medical imaging, and artistic displays. It plays a crucial role in modern technology, particularly in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications.</p>
        <p><em>Trivia:</em> Dennis Gabor won the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics (1971)</strong> for this work.</p>

        <h2>The Physics Behind Holography</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Both <strong>amplitude</strong> and <strong>phase</strong> of light are recorded.</li>
            <li>Two-step process:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Recording</strong>: Capturing the object as a photographic record (hologram).</li>
                    <li><strong>Reconstruction</strong>: Recreating the image from the hologram.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Coherent light</strong> (e.g., lasers) is essential for holography.</li>
            <li>Holography relies on the principle of <strong>interference and diffraction</strong>. When two coherent light waves overlap, they create an interference pattern that encodes both the intensity and phase information of the object.</li>
            <li>A <strong>beam splitter</strong> is often used to divide the laser beam into an <strong>object beam</strong> (which illuminates the object) and a <strong>reference beam</strong> (which directly reaches the recording medium).</li>
            <li>The recorded interference pattern appears as an abstract set of lines or curves but contains all the necessary data to recreate the 3D image when properly illuminated.</li>
            <li>Unlike traditional optics, which focuses on capturing direct images, holography reconstructs wavefronts, enabling accurate depth perception and parallax.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Construction and Interference</h2>
        <p>The object is illuminated with <strong>monochromatic, coherent laser light</strong>. The <strong>reference beam and object beam</strong> interact to create <strong>interference patterns</strong> on a photographic plate. This interference pattern contains all the object's visual information.</p>

        <h2>The Hologram Comes to Life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The hologram is illuminated by a <strong>collimated laser beam</strong>.</li>
            <li>Acts as a <strong>diffraction grating</strong> to create:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>virtual image</strong>, observed by looking through the hologram.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>real image</strong>, which can be captured on a photographic plate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Phase differences in light waves provide <strong>depth perception</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Holography vs. Photography</h2>
        <p><strong>Conventional Photography:</strong> Captures only <strong>2D information</strong> (amplitude).</p>
        <p><strong>Holography:</strong> Records both <strong>amplitude and phase</strong>, preserving <strong>depth and parallax</strong>.</p>
        <p>A hologram is a <strong>complex interference pattern</strong>.</p>
        <p><em>Trivia:</em> The <strong>March 1984 issue</strong> of <strong>National Geographic</strong> was the first to feature a <strong>hologram on its cover</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Construction and Reconstruction of a Hologram</h2>
        <h3>Construction of a Hologram</h3>
        <p>The process of recording a hologram involves:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A laser beam is split into two: an <strong>object beam</strong> and a <strong>reference beam</strong>.</li>
            <li>The object beam illuminates the object, and the light is scattered onto the recording medium.</li>
            <li>The reference beam directly reaches the recording medium, interfering with the object beam to create an interference pattern.</li>
            <li>This interference pattern is recorded as a hologram.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Reconstruction of a Hologram</h3>
        <p>To reconstruct the hologram:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The recorded hologram is illuminated with the same coherent laser.</li>
            <li>The interference pattern diffracts the light to recreate the original wavefront.</li>
            <li>A three-dimensional virtual or real image appears.</li>
        </ol>
